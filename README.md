# CNNTime
Feature extracted time series data transformed to torchvision format for use in CNN transfer learning. 

Resource includes python code with concept/example pipeline work for translating time series data after feature extraction process to feed CNN pre-trained or customized model. Current work supports pytorch tools. Above mentioned process is expected to apply in following application:

--> Additive Manufacturing Sensor data to predict faults.
--> Jet propulsion data to predict stall warning.
--> Surface Electromyography Signal for predicting motion.

Future work will include research results for above pointed application
